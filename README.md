# Filtering-R

This project was all about data preparation. File acuired with sql querry had more than 5 000 000 rows. Filtering this file in excel 
was causing excel freezing, crushing or with a stroke of luck finally I managed to filter it but it took a lot of time to 
excel to calculate my filtering conditions.

Therefore I created script that filters this file, and now it takes about 20 sec to perform this action.
